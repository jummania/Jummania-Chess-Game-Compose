# ♟️ Jummania-Chess-Game<br>— Customizable Chess Game for Compose Multiplatform

**Jummania-Chess-Game-Compose** is a fully-functional, customizable chess game built with **Jetpack
Compose Multiplatform**.  
It offers smooth interactions, realistic piece movements, and a highly customizable interface —
including board themes, piece styles, stroke options, and more.

This project includes complete chess gameplay logic:  
legal move validation, turn-based play, pawn promotion, and piece movement rules.  
It can be extended with AI opponents or multiplayer features for a seamless experience.

Designed for **Jetpack Compose UI**, it works across **Android**, **Desktop**, **Web**, and **other
platforms** with the same smooth gameplay experience.

You can explore the original version of this game in the
repository: [Jummania Chess Game on GitHub](https://github.com/Jumman04/Jummania-Chess-Game).

This project has since been extended to support Jetpack Compose, enabling a modern and
cross-platform chess game experience.

## 🧩 How to Use

Using the game is simple — just call the `ChessBoardCanvas` composable in your screen layout:

```kotlin
ChessBoardCanvas(
    chessController = chessController,  // Optional: your custom controller to manage the game state
    squareColors = SquareColors(),     // Optional: customize square colors
    symbolStyle = SymbolStyle(),       // Optional: customize piece symbols
    stroke = Stroke()                  // Optional: customize stroke effects
)
```

**Example**:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun ChessGameScreen() {
    ChessBoardCanvas()  // Uses default settings for a simple game
}
```

The game board is now interactive, and you can customize the colors, pieces, and strokes as needed.
